# Seoul_Bike-Sharing-Demand
Project Summary -
Seoul city locals can rent bicycles for a charge and for a set period of time. However, the demand for motorbikes varies according to various variables, and they cannot keep up. Our approach aims to estimate demand for rented bikes at any given time, considering all factors that will assist in regulating the flow of motorbikes. Rental bikes are already available in numerous urban locations to increase transit convenience. It is critical that the rental bikes are accessible and available to the general public at the proper time since this eliminates waiting. Maintaining a consistent supply of rental bikes for the city eventually emerges as a major issue. The ability to estimate the number of bikes needed each hour is essential. We are going to explore the machine learning algorithms which function effectively with the data and the factors that have a significant impact on the demand for rented bikes.

Problem Statement -
Currently, many large cities have accepted the usage of rental bikes to enhance the comfort of mobility. Since it reduces waiting, it is essential to make rental bikes accessible and available to the general public at the proper time. A consistent supply of rental bikes for the city eventually becomes a primary issue. It's crucial to estimate how many bikes will be required each hour in order to keep the supply of rental bikes stable.

Define Your Business Objective?
The demand for bike-sharing services is predicted using previous data by the bike-sharing demand prediction regression database in order to optimize fleet management, personnel, and pricing methods. This enables bike-sharing companies to deploy resources wisely, improving operational performance and profitability, based on user behavior and demand patterns. The demand prediction regression database for bike sharing's overarching goal is to provide bike-sharing companies with knowledge about consumer behavior and demand patterns in order to help them improve the efficiency and profitability of their operations.
